I am David Griswold, teacher, and computer programmer. I mostly work in scripting, spreadsheets, and javascript, but have also coded in R (Shiny) and Java.

You can see my (mostly defunct these days) teaching blog at <http://davidgriswoldhh.mtbos.org>

This page mostly lists coding projects I have completed in the past, some of which might be useful.

## Personal Projects

* Dice Roller - ([Project Page](https://www.github.com/DavidRGriswold/dice-roller) , [Live Page](https://davidrgriswold.github.io/dice-roller)) - a simple typescript app that allows you to roll an arbitrary number of dice with arbitrary sides.
  
* Word Christmas Tree([Project Page](https://www.github.com/DavidRGriswold/wordChristmasTree), [Live Page](https://davidrgriswold.github.io/wordChristmasTree/)) - a standalone CSS/HTML/JS project that will take any list of words and display it in the shape of a christmas tree, with optional blinking lights.

* Prototype Delta Skin Editor ([Project Page](https://github.com/DavidRGriswold/delta_skin_editor), [Live Page](https://davidrgriswold.github.io/delta_skin_editor/)) - Can be used to make functional skins for the Delta emulator on iOS. The project became unnecessary to continue after a certain point but what is there still works.

* Google Sheets Game Tracker Template ([Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12KsdEpw5uCSW0hLmR3qkizeRMfqS1SwCrbSN1vne-is)). A complex multi-layer spreadsheet that allows users to track their video game usage with summaries and automatic tier lists. Connects to a Node express API point that automatically downloads relevant information from the Internet Game Database.

## Open Source Contributions

* Lime 3DS Emulator ([Project Page](https://github.com/lime3ds/lime3ds)) - Added several features to the user interface on android and windows, collaborated with maintainers to make sure everything worked well. Learned about QT and Kotlin in the process.

* Shiny ColourPicker ([Project Page](https://github.com/daattali/colourpicker)) - Added an alpha slider to this open source tool, collaborated with maintainer over several weeks to get it working well.

## Professional projects

I worked for a little over a year for [CPM](https://www.cpm.org) where I helped them write a textbook for AP Statistics. In the process I also coded a splash page and a series of statistical applets in R/Shiny, which can be found [at this link](https://stats.cpm.org). 

## Projects I did for school teaching

* IB Computer Science Notes for Graded (under Github name DavidGriswoldTeacher) ([Project Page](https://github.com/graded-cs-resources/IB-Computer-Science-Notes), [Live Page](https://graded-cs-resources.github.io/IB-Computer-Science-Notes/)) - Contains a wide variety of notes and resources for the IB Computer Science Course. Written in Markdown with the help of Jekyll and custom styles.

* CodingBatPseudo ([Project Page](https://github.com/graded-cs-resources/CodingBatPseudo), [Live Page](https://graded-cs-resources.github.io/CodingBatPseudo/)) - A heavily modified version of [CodingJS](https://the-winter.github.io/codingjs/) that ports problems from [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com) to javascript. This version one allows users to write code in IB-style Pseudocode, javascript, or typescript, and includes many custom questions to help students with IB-style questions.

* Template for working with Processing as a Java library in Visual Studio Code or GitPod ([Project Page](https://github.com/graded-cs-resources/processing_java_starter_vscode/tree/master))

* Template for working with P5.JS in Visual Studio code or gitpod with the addition of typings for autcomplete ([Project Page](https://github.com/graded-cs-resources/p5js-starter-with-typings))

*  Graded *Web Design* Course About Page, 2019-2020 - ([Project Page](https://github.com/DavidRGriswold/graded-web-design-about-page-2019) , [Live Page](https://davidrgriswold.github.io/graded-web-design-about-page-2019/))
  
*  Graded *Programming Essentials* Course About Page, 2019-2020 - ([Project Page](https://github.com/DavidRGriswold/graded-programming-essentials-about-page-2019) , [Live Page](https://davidrgriswold.github.io/graded-programming-essentials-about-page-2019/))
